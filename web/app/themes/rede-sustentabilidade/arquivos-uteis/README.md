AWS S3 Bucket Browser 
=====================

S3 Bucket Browser, **fully based on AWS JavaScript API**, see http://aws.amazon.com/sdkfornodejs/

Base on the idea of : https://github.com/rgrp/s3-bucket-listing and inspired on the current S3 Browser from Amazon.

Intent for public or private usage, you can deploy this files on any web site.

Not intent for deploy on your own bucket (for me no make sense).

Using the new IAM Users from AWS you can provide more specific and secure access to your buckets.

## Usage

**Notes** I recommend create specific user or roles to access bucket to browse, then generate their access key, for now this code is intent only for browse, then no need to create a user with other privileges just use ListObjects. Check this link http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/PoliciesOverview.html

1) Copy the files on your web site. Could be based on Apache or IIS.

2) Modify the setting in file js/config.js

    var AWS_AccessKeyId = ''; //Your credentials for specific user and privileges
    var AWS_SecretAccessKey = ''; //Your credentials for specific user and privileges
    var AWS_Region = 'us-east-1';
    var AWS_BucketName = '';
    var AWS_MaxKeys = 500; //How many objects will retrive (include folders and items)
    var AWS_Prefix = ''; //Stating folder, by default start on root of bucket
    //Check this parameter in http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#getSignedUrl-property
    var AWS_SignedUrl_Expires = 900; //This is the default value for expires getSignedUrl (value in seconds, 15 mins set)
    var TITLE = 'S3 Bucket browser';
	
3) Navigate to index.html and start browsing...
